However, it only features two figures rather than three, and it lacks the interaction dynamics described in the prompt (speaking, listening, and non-verbal cues).\n3. **Visual Quality (25/30 points)**: The image shows high visual quality with a harmonious color palette of blues and greens. The clarity and resolution are good, and the overall aesthetic is professional.\n4. **Presentation Suitability (20/30 points)**: While visually appealing, the illustration doesn't fully support the slide's message of communication among three people. The composition is simple and focused but does not entirely fit the context described in the prompt.",
