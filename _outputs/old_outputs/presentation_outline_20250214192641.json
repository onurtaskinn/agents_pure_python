            "feedback": "The image captures the essence of Gen Z financial management, but it has some critical issues that prevent it from fully meeting the requirements. The main problems are the presence of text within the image and a slight deviation from the specified visual style. Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n1. Critical Issues:\n   - Contains text within the image (e.g., 'Gen Z Budget', 'Expense', 'Savings')\n   - Visual style doesn't fully match the specified 'minimalist' and 'flat design' requirements\n\n2. Prompt Alignment (25/40):\n   - The split-screen layout is present\n   - Digital interface with charts and graphs is included\n   - Young adult with smartphone is depicted\n   - Color palette is close to the requested soft blues and greens\n   - However, the style is not strictly minimalist or flat as requested\n\n3. Visual Quality (25/30):\n   - Resolution and clarity are good\n   - Color balance and contrast are pleasing\n   - Lighting is even and clear\n   - Professional appearance overall\n\n4. Presentation Suitability (20/30):\n   - Fits the presentation context of Gen Z financial management\n   - Supports the slide message effectively\n   - Some elements are more detailed than necessary for a minimalist design\n   - Focus on key message is clear, but could be more simplified",
            "suggestions": "To improve the image and align it more closely with the prompt:\n\n1. Remove all text from the image, including labels on charts and graphs\n2. Simplify the charts and graphs to use only basic shapes and minimal detail\n3. Use a cleaner, more minimalist style for both the interface and the person\n4. Ensure a perfect 50/50 split between the left and right sides of the image\n5. Use a pure white background to enhance the minimalist feel\n6. Adjust the color palette to use only soft blues and greens for financial elements, with light gray for interface outlines\n7. Simplify the young adult's appearance to match a flat design style\n8. Remove small details like the watch/bracelet on the person's wrist\n9. Make the smartphone interface visible but without any specific app details\n\nBy implementing these changes, the image would better align with the requested minimalist, flat design style while maintaining its core message about Gen Z financial management.",

However, there are several deviations from the prompt: the figure is centrally positioned rather than slightly left of center, the crossroads element is missing, and only one path (leading to a Bitcoin logo) is shown instead of the requested three paths. The image maintains simplicity and clarity, which is appropriate for a presentation context.",
            "suggestions": "To improve the image's alignment with the prompt: 1) Adjust the figure's position slightly to the left. 2) Add a subtle geometric crossroads element with thin lines. 3) Include two additional paths: one with simplified coin icons and another with minimalist upward-trending line graphs. 4) Implement the requested gradient from light blue to lime green in the background. 5) Consider adding a hint of muted orange for contrast, as specified in the prompt.",
            "current_prompt": "Minimalist vector illustration of a Gen Z individual at a stylized crossroads. The figure stands slightly left of center, wearing simple smart casual attire and holding a smartphone. Their facial expression is determined. A subtle geometric crossroads element of thin lines underlies the scene. Three distinct paths extend from the crossroads to the right: one made of simplified coin icons, another of minimalist upward-trending line graphs, and the third featuring a basic Bitcoin logo. The background has a smooth gradient from light blue (top left) to lime green (bottom right). Use clean, sharp vector lines in a flat design style without shading or texture. Composition: figure occupies left third, paths fill right two-thirds. Lighting is bright and even, creating a hopeful mood. Color palette: light blue, lime green, dark blue, white, and muted orange for contrast. Ensure high contrast between elements and background for readability. Ultra-modern, minimalist style suitable for a presentation slide. All elements simplified and iconic, avoiding complex details.",
