The leaders should represent different genders, ethnicities, and ages (30s to 60s). The semi-transparent board displays only simple, abstract geometric shapes in blues, greens, and purples, representing action plans and gender equality concepts. No text or writing should be visible anywhere in the image. Use a clean, corporate visual style with a bright, optimistic color palette dominated by soft blues, muted greens, and light purples. Employ soft, diffused lighting to create a positive atmosphere. The composition should be balanced and simplified, with the semi-transparent strategy board as the focal point and leaders arranged in a semi-circle around it. One leader should be gesturing towards the board, indicating a collaborative discussion. The room should have minimal details - a sleek table and simple chairs only - to focus attention on the people and the board. The overall scene should convey teamwork, strategic planning, and inclusive leadership in a visually clean manner suitable for a presentation slide.

The visual style is clean and corporate with a bright, optimistic color palette. However, there are several problems that make it unsuitable for the specified requirements:\n\n1. The image contains text and writing within the strategy board, which violates a critical requirement.\n2. The number of leaders shown is 4, not the requested 5-6.\n3. The strategy board is not semi-transparent as requested.\n4. The geometric shapes on the board are not limited to blues, greens, and purples as specified.\n5. The leaders are not arranged in a semi-circle around the board.\n6. No leader is visibly gesturing towards the board.\n\nOn the positive side, the image does showcase diversity in gender and ethnicity, uses appropriate colors, and has a clean, minimalist style suitable for a presentation slide.
