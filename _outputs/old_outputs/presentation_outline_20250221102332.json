On the left, place a simple, clean silhouette of a classical Greek column in dark gray. On the right, add a simplified atom symbol silhouette in the same dark gray. Connect these with a subtle, flowing golden line featuring 3-4 glowing nodes. Apply delicate watercolor washes for the background. Use fine line art for the column and atom symbols, ensuring they are clearly defined yet not overly detailed. Add gentle golden highlights to the edges of the column, atom, and nodes to enhance their presence. Center the composition with ample negative space and margins. The golden line should gracefully curve between the symbols, emphasizing the flow of wisdom. Use soft edges and subtle depth to maintain the transcendent feel.

            "feedback": "The image does not fully match the provided prompt and lacks several key elements. While it captures a dreamy, ethereal atmosphere with a soft gradient background of muted blues and grays, it's missing the critical components described in the prompt. There's no Greek column silhouette on the left, no atom symbol on the right, and the golden line, while present, doesn't connect these missing elements. The image does feature a flowing golden line with glowing nodes, which partially aligns with the prompt. The overall minimalist and ethereal style is appropriate for a presentation slide, but the composition doesn't match the specific requirements.",
            "suggestions": "To improve the image, add the missing elements: a simple Greek column silhouette on the left and an atom symbol on the right, both in dark gray. Ensure the golden line connects these symbols. Remove or reduce the cloud-like elements as they weren't specified in the prompt. Adjust the composition to center the main elements with more negative space. Consider adding subtle golden highlights to the edges of the column and atom symbols when they're included. Maintain the current high image quality and smooth color transitions.",
