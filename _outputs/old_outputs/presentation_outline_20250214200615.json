Multimedia Design (27/30):\n   - The balance between onscreen and voiceover text is good, but the onscreen text could be more concise.\n   - The voiceover provides additional context, which is positive.\n   - The image prompt is relevant and enhances the content well.\n\n3. Technical Quality (28/30):\n   - HTML markup is correctly used for the most part, but the <h2> tag should be replaced with a more appropriate tag for slide content, such as <h1> for the main title.\n   - The image prompt is clear and specific, but could benefit from mentioning the slide title explicitly.\n   - Language consistency is maintained throughout.\n   - The professional tone is appropriate for the content.\n\nTotal Score: 90/100\n\nWhile the content is generally of high quality, it falls short of the perfect score required for validity due to minor issues in content alignment, HTML usage, and slight improvements needed in onscreen text conciseness.",

            "current_prompt": "Create a minimalist illustration for a presentation on communication and networking. Set in a bright, modern office space with warm, diffused lighting. Display exactly 4 diverse, geometric silhouettes arranged in a perfect semi-circle, using only circles for heads and triangles for bodies. At the center, place a large, sleek rectangular touchscreen. On the touchscreen, display exactly 4 distinct, simple icons in a 2x2 grid: a bullseye (top left), a calendar (top right), a growing network diagram (bottom left), and two clasping hands (bottom right). Use a color palette of soft sky blue (#87CEEB) for the background, crisp white (#FFFFFF) for the silhouettes and touchscreen, and muted coral orange (#FF7F50) for the icons. Include thin, subtle white connection lines between the silhouettes. Add small, abstract network nodes as simple dots floating in the blue background. Convey progress through upward-flowing design elements like thin, diagonal white lines in the background. Ensure high contrast between elements for clear visibility. Maintain a strictly minimalist style with no text, no complex details, and no recognizable individuals. Angle the silhouettes slightly towards the center touchscreen. Use only clean, straight lines and basic geometric shapes throughout the composition. Ensure the image is high-resolution (at least 4K) and suitable for presentation use with clear, crisp edges on all elements.",

Include thin, subtle white connection lines between the silhouettes. Add small, abstract network nodes as simple dots floating in the blue background, ensuring they are evenly distributed. Convey progress through upward-flowing design elements like thin, diagonal white lines in the background, making them more prominent and numerous. Ensure high contrast between elements for clear visibility. Maintain a strictly minimalist style with no text, no complex details, and no recognizable individuals. Angle the silhouettes slightly towards the center touchscreen. Use only clean, straight lines and basic geometric shapes throughout the composition. Remove any decorative elements like plants. Enhance the connection between silhouettes by adding more subtle network nodes and lines. Ensure the image is high-resolution (at least 4K) and suitable for presentation use with clear, crisp edges on all elements."
