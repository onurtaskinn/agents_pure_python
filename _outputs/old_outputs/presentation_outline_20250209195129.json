Right side: modern urban skyline with skyscrapers and industrial zones. Use a vintage photographic style with sepia tones transitioning to vibrant colors. Include a rising stock market graph overlaid with '1980: 2.3% - 1987: 9.8% GDP Growth'. Show Turkish Lira symbols and icons representing privatization and foreign investment. Display a map of Turkey with arrows indicating global trade connections. Include silhouettes of people transitioning from traditional to modern attire. Incorporate Turgut \u00d6zal's silhouette subtly overseeing the transformation. Add visual cues of key economic reforms: a factory being privatized, a customs checkpoint opening, and modern communication technologies emerging."

Content Coherence (38/40): The alignment between onscreen text, voiceover, and image prompt is excellent. However, the voiceover could briefly mention the 'Toplumsal ve Siyasal Yap\u0131da De\u011fi\u015fimler' point that's listed in the onscreen text to ensure complete alignment.\n\n2. Multimedia Design (28/30): The balance between onscreen and voiceover text is good, but the onscreen text could be slightly more concise. Consider combining the first two bullet points to create more visual space.\n\n3. Technical Quality (29/30): The HTML markup is correct, and the image prompt is detailed and specific. However, the language consistency could be improved by using either 'GSY\u0130H' or 'GDP' consistently across all elements.\n\nOverall, the content is of high quality but needs these minor adjustments to achieve full marks.",
