However, there appears to be some text visible in the code on both screens and possibly a '5:54' time indicator on the right, though these are minimal and appear as part of the coding interface rather than substantive text content.

The most significant issue is that it contains actual code/text throughout both sides of the image, when the prompt specifically requested 'ABSOLUTELY NO text, code snippets, labels or writing of any kind.' The image does have the requested split-screen layout comparing traditional vs. AI-powered code review, with a human silhouette on the left and automated scanning visualization on the right. It includes red bug symbols and uses a blue color scheme as specified. However, the extensive code text makes it inappropriate for the intended use. The image also doesn't fully follow the minimalist geometric style requested, instead showing more detailed code representation than abstract patterns/blocks.",

Several red bug symbols (stylized geometric insects) and security vulnerability icons (simple broken shield shapes) are embedded within the pattern but clearly being overlooked by the developer. RIGHT SIDE: The identical abstract code pattern with a prominent blue scanning beam moving across it.

The blue and purple gradient background with glowing elements creates a modern tech aesthetic that aligns perfectly with the slide's theme of AI-accelerated learning.

However, there are a few issues to note: (1) The image contains some small text elements within the holographic displays (showing percentages like '6.15%' and '750,000%'). While these enhance the futuristic feel, they technically violate the 'no text within image' requirement.

The message about AI-assisted software development is clearly delivered across all elements. The onscreen text provides concise bullet points that summarize key benefits, while the voiceover expands on these points with appropriate detail. The image prompt effectively visualizes the concept by requesting a futuristic workspace that shows the human-AI collaboration described in the text.\n\nThe multimedia design is well-balanced. The onscreen text uses proper HTML formatting with a heading and bullet points, making it scannable and easy to digest. The voiceover complements rather than duplicates the onscreen text, providing additional context and explanation. The image prompt is detailed and specific, clearly describing visual elements that will reinforce the message about AI-enhanced productivity and innovation.\n\nTechnically, the HTML markup is correctly implemented with proper heading tags and unordered list elements. The language is consistent throughout, maintaining the Turkish language in all content elements. The tone is professional and optimistic, appropriate for a presentation about future technology. The image prompt provides clear direction for creating a visual that will enhance the slide's message.\n\nNo critical issues were identified in this slide content.",

            "current_prompt": "Create a minimalist, futuristic digital workspace showing collaboration between software developers and AI. Feature a clean, bright office environment with 2-3 partial human silhouettes positioned to actively interact with holographic elements. Display 4-5 scattered, floating, transparent holographic elements with abstract blue geometric patterns and simplified data visualizations (absolutely NO text, letters, numbers, or alphanumeric characters of any kind). Show distinct, prominent glowing blue digital energy patterns flowing directly between human hands/fingers and the holographic elements, clearly representing AI assistance and collaboration. Include simple, abstract upward-trending blue patterns and a stylized, minimalist blue light bulb symbol representing innovation. Use exclusively blue and white color palette with soft, optimistic lighting creating a hopeful atmosphere. Ensure exactly 30-40% negative space throughout the composition for a truly minimalist aesthetic. The floating holographic elements must appear lightweight, well-distributed in 3D space, and semi-transparent rather than as solid screens. Focus on depicting the interactive relationship between human creativity and AI collaboration through abstract visual elements only - no symbols that could be interpreted as text. High-quality, semi-abstract visualization suitable for a presentation about the future of software development processes and AI integration. Bright, clean lighting with subtle shadows to enhance depth."
