Center-left: position a confident presenter (35% from left) in navy business attire, facing right with subtle, professional hand gestures. Right side: arrange 4 diverse business professionals in a clear semi-circle (45% image width), showing varied engagement through distinct micro-expressions - one nodding slightly, another leaning forward with thoughtful expression, two others displaying subtle hand gestures of active listening. Top-right: place a large semi-transparent circular diagram (40% opacity) with 85% filled segment in deep navy (#1a3c5a). Add 4 delicate, ethereal connecting lines in pale blue (#a8d8ea, 15% opacity) flowing organically between presenter and each audience member. Background: warm light gray (#f5f5f5) with subtle radial gradient for depth. Lighting: soft directional from 45\u00b0 above with 25% ambient fill, casting gentle shadows. Bottom-right corner: include small, modern potted succulent (15% of image height). Style: semi-realistic with simplified facial features, clean lines, smooth color transitions. Maintain professional atmosphere with strong focus on non-verbal communication cues. Ultra-high resolution with crisp figure edges and soft shadow details. Reserve 35% negative space on right side for balance."

            "feedback": "The image effectively represents a 30-60-90 day action plan through a well-designed circular journey diagram. While the overall execution is strong, there are a few notable points:\n\n1. Content Alignment (35/40):\n- Excellent circular layout with compass center as requested\n- Clear three-segment division matching the timeline\n- Professional figures showing networking activities\n- Isometric design implemented effectively\n- Small icons present but could be more distinct\n\n2. Visual Quality (28/30):\n- High resolution and clarity\n- Excellent blue and white color scheme\n- Professional shadows and depth\n- Clean, modern corporate style\n- Strong lighting effects\n\n3. Presentation Suitability (25/30):\n- Supports the slide message well\n- Some text elements visible which should be removed\n- Good use of space and composition\n- Clear visual hierarchy",
            "suggestions": "To improve the image:\n1. Remove all visible text elements from the diagram\n2. Increase the size of activity icons for better visibility\n3. Consider adding more distinct visual markers between the 30-60-90 day segments\n4. Simplify some of the background elements to reduce visual noise\n5. Add more clear progress indicators or checkpoints along the circle's edge as specified in the original prompt",
            "current_prompt": "Create a modern and professional infographic illustration showing a circular journey diagram divided into three main segments (30-60-90 days), using a clean corporate art style with a blue and white color scheme. Each segment should contain simple icons representing different networking and communication activities. The center of the circle should feature a compass or target symbol, suggesting direction and goal achievement. Include small progress bars or checkpoints along the circle's edge. The overall style should be minimalist and professional, with subtle shadows and a light grid background. The illustration should incorporate small human figures networking and communicating at different stages of the journey. Use isometric design elements to add depth and dimension to the visualization."
