From traditional instruments like the ba\u011flama to contemporary fusion performances, T\u00fcrk Halk M\u00fczi\u011fi represents a powerful connection between past and present, preserving cultural identity while constantly evolving.",
            "slide_image_prompt": "A split-screen photographic composition showing a traditional Turkish folk musician playing a ba\u011flama on one side, and a modern young musician incorporating traditional folk elements in a contemporary music performance on the other side. Use a warm, earthy color palette with rich browns, deep reds, and golden tones. The image should have a documentary-style realism, capturing the emotional depth and cultural continuity of Turkish folk music. Lighting should emphasize the musicians' expressions and the intricate details of the instruments."
