        You are tasked to generate high quality content for a slide.

        This slide will be part of a presentation titled: {presentation_title}
        The title of the slide is: {slide_title}
        Tha main focus of the slide should be derived from the following statement: {slide_focus}

        Consider both presentation title and the slide title. Make sure that you understand what this slide should focus on.
        Then, follow a step by step approach to decide how you should create content for this slide.

        The slide must be organized as a means to convey information and key messages regarding the main topic of presentation and particular focus of this slide.
        The slide will have some on screen text to let the user follow what is being discussed and also on screen text must help user to get the intended message even if there is no voiceover or images.
        The onscreen text must be concise and prescriptive when it is meaningful.
        The slide will also have some voiceover text that will be read by a speaker.
        The onscreen text and voiceover text must be determined in coherence. Apply the multimedia design principles to generate coherent texts for screen and voiceover.
        The slide will also have an image to enrich its content beyond a text only look.
        I will later use another AI model to generate image for this slide. But I need a detailed and well-written textual prompt to do that.
        Before writing the prompt, think about the entire context for this slide, presentation, slide title, focus, on screen text and voiceover text.
        First, come up with a good visual idea that would make sense with the rest of the information, context and message we provide here.
        Then express this visual idea with a detailed and descriptive manner as a textual prompt. It is important that your image prompt to be clear, descriptive and detailed.
        Remember that you must specify some visual style as part of the image prompt as well.


        Now take a deep breath and carry out the tasks we set so far.
        You will give your response ensuring that it has all of the following:

        slide_title
        slide_onscreen_text
        slide_voiceover_text
        slide_image_prompt
